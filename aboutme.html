        <h1>My Journey: From Village Beginnings to Tech Aspirations</h1>
        <p>
            My journey began in a small village, where I completed my 10th and 11th grades at Adarsh Public School, Uplai, in <span class="highlight">2016</span> and <span class="highlight">2017</span>. These years nurtured my early curiosity, as I laid the foundation of my academic journey. With a thirst for knowledge, I moved to Emerald Higher Secondary School in Jaora for my 12th grade in <span class="highlight">2018</span>, choosing Mathematics as my focus subject. This experience fueled my interest in analytical thinking and problem-solving, preparing me for greater challenges.
            <br><br>
            The next major step was my enrollment at Shri Yogindra Sagar Institute of Technology and Science in Ratlam, where I pursued a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology from <span class="highlight">2018 to 2022</span>. My college life was transformative; here, I founded my first entrepreneurial venture, an online store called <span class="highlight">Jaora Collection</span>, through which I launched a Shopify website <a href="http://jaoracollection.in" target="_blank">jaoracollection.in</a>. I learned the ropes of e-commerce, handling Facebook ads, and engaging customers, which was an exciting experience that blended my tech skills with real-world business.
            <br><br>
            After completing my B.Tech in <span class="highlight">June 2022</span>, I took a month-long break to rejuvenate. Soon after, on <span class="highlight">July 24, 2022</span>, I moved to Indore, marking the beginning of a new phase in my career. I took on a role as an Accountant Assistant at Shankar Soya Pvt. Ltd., gaining experience in financial management. Alongside, I enrolled in a C and C++ course at Universal Informatics to sharpen my programming skills. After my role there, I pursued an intensive Java Full Stack Development course from March to December 2023. This training exposed me to real-world projects, like developing a pharmacy store and car rental platform. I delved into core technologies, honing my expertise in Java, Spring, and database management.
            <br><br>
            Eager to explore more, I taught myself Shopify, PHP, and freelancing basics through online classes and YouTube. My dedication led me to an internship at Ecommerce Web Guru Pvt. Ltd., where I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Shopify, building dynamic websites and expanding my portfolio. With each step, I have embraced new skills and look forward to what lies ahead, driven by a passion for technology and lifelong learning.
