        <h1>Database Development - Projects</h1>
        <h2>Universal Informatics & Self-Learning</h2>

        <p><strong>Training Duration:</strong> Learned over several months through Universal Informatics and self-study on platforms like YouTube.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
        I developed strong database management skills during my time at Universal Informatics and through personal learning on YouTube. I worked on multiple projects using MySQL and SQL, focusing on practical implementation of databases in real-world scenarios. These projects not only helped me understand complex queries but also gave me hands-on experience with database structures, table relationships, and data manipulation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Projects:</strong><br>
        <strong>Pharmacy Store Database:</strong> Designed a fully functional database system for a pharmacy store, handling customer registrations, doctor appointments, and medicine orders. The project was developed using MySQL, with efficient data management and streamlined operations for users.<br><br>
        <strong>Rockstar Booking Platform:</strong> Developed a relational database for managing show bookings and user data, allowing users to book events and view availability of artists. This project emphasized SQL queries for booking data retrieval and user management.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> MySQL, SQL, Relational Database Management, Data Modeling, Database Queries, PHPMyAdmin.</p>
